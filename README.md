#	BEAM CALCULATOR
Beam Calculator is a tool developed in Python to simplify beam analysis. The program features a clean interface created with Customtkinter and visually displays the effects of applied loads and supports on the beam. Users can easily adjust various beam parameters and analyze the effects of loads.

#	FEATURES

BEAM SETTINGS:

+Beam length is adjustable.

+Length and force units are customizable.

SUPPORT TYPES:

+Pin Support

+Fixed Support

+Roller Support

LOAD TYPES:

+Point Load (Noktasal Yük)

+Moment

+Uniformly Distributed Load (Üçgen Yük)

#	ANALYSIS OPTIONS

Shear Force Diagram: Displays the shear forces.

Bending Moment Diagram: Visualizes the bending moments.

Deflection Diagram: Shows the deflection of the beam. For this analysis, values for moment of inertia and Young's modulus must be provided.
